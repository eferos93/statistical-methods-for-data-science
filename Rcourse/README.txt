Dear students,

in the subfolders you find updated slides, scripts and datasets of the course. 

Start with the slides in the .html file, you will find instructions when it is time to switch to the Rscript (the .R file).

I rearranged the content of some slides in order to correctly export them. 
If you experience alignment problems with the html files please:
 1. try to zoom out a bit (cntr -/cmd -)  and  open again the file
 2. try with a different browser
 3. write me an email: gioia.dicredico@deams.units.it

Best of luck!
Gioia
